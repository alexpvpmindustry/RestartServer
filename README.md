a christmas present to the public servers.

this is to prevent lag machines from hogging the server resources in sandbox.

just place the .jar file into the `config/mods` directory and the server will automatically restart whenever there are no players for more than 30mins.
This 30mins is calculated on a rolling basis, so there must be no players in the previous 30mins in order for the restart to occur.


ALSO, here is a piece of coal for all the server griefers.
